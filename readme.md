## Overview

This script automates chat interactions using the OpenAI GPT-3.5 API. It monitors chat messages, checks if the last message is from a specified sender, and generates a witty response in Hindi, Nepali, or English based on the chat history. The script utilizes the `pyautogui` library for GUI automation and `pyperclip` for clipboard management.

## Features

- Monitors a specified chat window and checks the last message sender.
- Generates automated responses using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 based on chat history.
- Supports multi-language responses (Hindi, Nepali, English).
- User-friendly automation using mouse clicks and keyboard shortcuts.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - `pyautogui`
  - `time`
  - `pyperclip`
  - `openai`

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pyautogui pyperclip openai
```

## Usage

1. **Set Up API Key**:
   - Replace `"<Your Key Here>"` in the script with your OpenAI API key.

2. **Run the Script**:
   - Execute the script in your Python environment. Ensure you have a chat application open and the relevant chat window in focus.

3. **Chat Monitoring**:
   - The script will automatically:
     - Click on the Chrome icon to bring the chat window to focus.
     - Monitor for messages every 5 seconds.
     - Check if the last message is from "Rohan Das".
     - Generate and paste a witty response if the condition is met.

4. **Chat Interaction**:
   - The script simulates mouse clicks and keyboard shortcuts to select, copy, and paste text within the chat application.

## Important Notes

- The script uses fixed coordinates for mouse clicks and drags; adjust them according to your screen resolution and application layout.
- Ensure that the chat application remains in the same position on your screen; otherwise, the script may not work correctly.
- Always run this script in a controlled environment to avoid unintended interactions with other applications.

## Example Chat Interaction

1. **User Message**: *"Why are you always late?"*
2. **Automated Response**: *"Because even my watch thinks Iâ€™m on 'Nepal time'!"*
